# flutterApp


It’s a good idea to have a uses-material-design: true entry in the flutter section of your pubspec.yaml file. This will allow you to use more features of Material, such as their set of predefined Icons.


In this step, you’ll start using an open-source package named english_words, which contains a few thousand of the most used English words plus some utility functions.
`flutter pub add english_words`
`flutter pub get`
