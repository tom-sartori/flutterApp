It’s a good idea to have a uses-material-design: true entry in the flutter section of your pubspec.yaml file. This will allow you to use more features of Material, such as their set of predefined Icons.


In this step, you’ll start using an open-source package named english_words, which contains a few thousand of the most used English words plus some utility functions.
`flutter pub add english_words`
`flutter pub get`



Stateless widgets are immutable, meaning that their properties can’t change—all values are final.   
Stateful widgets maintain state that might change during the lifetime of the widget. Implementing a stateful widget requires at least two classes: 1) a StatefulWidget class that creates an instance of 2) a State class. The StatefulWidget class is, itself, immutable and can be thrown away and regenerated, but the State class persists over the lifetime of the widget.
